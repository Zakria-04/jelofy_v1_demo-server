[# 🚀 Jelofy – Demo Server v1

🌐 Live Demo: [https://jelofy.com](https://jelofy.com)

Welcome to **Jelofy**, a web application that allows restaurant owners to build and manage their own digital menus — without writing a single line of code.

This demo is the **first version** of the platform and showcases the core functionality and flexible design approach used to build it.

## 💡 Project Idea

Jelofy gives **restaurant owners** full control over creating and customizing their digital menus — no need to hire a developer or waste money on overpriced, unfinished services.

✅ Key features include:
- Add, edit, or delete meals  
- Use your own **currency**  
- Customize your **menu URL**  
- Generate a **unique QR code** for your digital menu  
- Choose from multiple **menu templates**
- No need for a developer — all features are self-managed

---

## 🔮 Future Features

The system is designed with scalability in mind — it's easy to add new features and designs.

For example:
- When a new **menu template** is ready, all you need to do is plug it into the store.
- Users will immediately be able to use the new template without needing major changes.

Everything is built with **extensibility** and **modularity** in mind.
